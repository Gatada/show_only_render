# Show Only Render
Show only objects that are enabled in renders.

- Install the .py file in Blender (done via Preferences > Add-ons).
- In the 3D Viewport, go to the Sidebar (N) > View and enable Show Only Render.
- Optionally enable the Refresh on Frame Change (useful if previewing animations in the viewport).

This will hide non-renderable objects when clicking the box. The visibility of objects do not update automatically (instead you have to cycle the Show Only Render checkbox to force a manual refresh).


However, if you have the Refresh on Frame Change option enabled, the visibility of the objects in the scene will update every time you change the current frame.
