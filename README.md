# Show Only Render
Show only renderable objects (similar to the eponym feature in Blender 2.79) by hidding non renderable objects.

- Install the .py file in Blender
- In the viewport > N key to show the right menu > View tab > Show Only Render

This will hide non-renderable objects when clicking the box. This does not update automatically, it's required to click it again to hide newly hidden objects.
