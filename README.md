# Show Only Render
Show only objects that are enabled in renders.

- Install the .py file in Blender (done via Preferences > Add-ons).
- In the 3D Viewport, go to the Sidebar (N) > View and enable Show Only Render.
- Optionally enable the Refresh on Frame Change (useful if previewing animations in the viewport).

## Usage

Enable the option to Show Only Render to hide non-renderable objects. The visibility of objects do not update automatically, so to manually update the visibility click the refresh button.

However, if you have the Refresh on Frame Change option enabled, the visibility of the objects in the scene will update every time you change the current frame.
